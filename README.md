# Virtual Software defined network over Raspberry pi Cluster

> _**V**irtual **S**DN **o**ver **R**aspberryPi **C**luster_
This is the original version(later to be replaced by a new web and a TUI) of the
website that controls and monitor a cluster of ~Raspberry pis~ computers that
run the [VSORCdistro](https://github.com/josuer08/VSoRCdistro "l3 openvswitch playground" ) suite.

While this is a work in progress you can [read the official document(in spanish)](https://josue.xyz/uploads/VSoRC.pdf)
resulting from the development and research of this project.
